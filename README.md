Testing various protein modelling tools 

## Tools of interest 

* [RFdiffusion](https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RFdiffusion): design novel protein backbones.
* [FoldingDiff](https://github.com/microsoft/foldingdiff): generate novel protein backbone structures. 
* [AlphaFold](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold): predict the 3D structure of designed proteins.
* [ColabFold](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold): predict the 3D structure of designed proteins on google colab.
* [FastFold](https://github.com/hpcaitech/FastFold): predict the 3D structure of designed proteins faster.
* [OmegaFold](https://github.com/HeliXonProtein/OmegaFold): predict the 3D structure of designed proteins without MSA. 
* [ProteinMPNN](https://github.com/dauparas/ProteinMPNN): optimise protein sequence for stability and desired properties.
